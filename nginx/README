This file is to describe how to deploy the nginx server and config the server to achieve the load balance.



When you move into the /COMP90024-city-analytics/nginx folder:

First of all, based on the new assigned ip address of other three instances, change the content of the nginx.conf file.

Replace the ip address behind the 'server' property in the 'upstream' structure with new assigned ip address and keep the port same.

Then, type the command './nginx_run.sh' in your command line to run the server.

When you see 'nginx' in the last line of the printed logs, it means the server start running successfully.
